### Description

I am aware that PSC has been posted with many key loggers b4, but i wanted to post one of my own..so here it is..This is a very small part of a project i am developing for a corporate client that wants a small trojan planted in his workgroup nopdes so that he knows what his employees are upto with their keyboard.Info is posted to the admin server program on his demand. The module i am posting is something i completed a month ago and constitutes about 10 % of my final product for the client. I have included only the relevant modules i am using . The interface of this sample code was intentionally kept simple(Where is the time???) Please look at the code..Its not really commented,largely because it is rather explanatory on its own except for a few API calls,which are very common calls in anyones API arsenal. REMEMBER: Please press F10 to show the form and F9 to hide it. Check the application root for the dump file which contains the logged entries.Please leave comments..
